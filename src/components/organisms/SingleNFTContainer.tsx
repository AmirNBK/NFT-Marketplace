                                    There are all sorts of beings in the NFT Universe. The most advanced and friendly of the bunch are Orbitians.

                                    These Orbitians are a peaceful race, but they have been at war with a group of invaders for many generations. The invaders are called Upside-Downs, because of their inverted bodies that live on the ground, yet do not know any other way to be. Upside-Downs believe that they will be able to win this war if they could only get an eye into Orbitian territory, so they&apos;ve taken to make human beings their target.
